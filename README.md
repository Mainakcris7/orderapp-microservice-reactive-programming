# üõçÔ∏è Order Booking Microservices System

A reactive, cloud-native **Microservices Architecture** built using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Cloud**, **Spring WebFlux**, **RabbitMQ**, **JWT Authentication**, and **Docker Compose**.

This project simulates a simple order booking system with distributed services like customer management, order placement, authentication, and notifications‚Äîall communicating synchronously/asynchronously and registered under a centralized Eureka discovery service.

|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **API Gateway**      | Entry point of all HTTP requests; routes to microservices                  |
| **Auth Service**     | Handles JWT-based registration, login, and token validation                |
| **Customer Service** | Manages customer data and communicates with Order & Notification services |
| **Order Service**    | Manages orders: create, update, delete, and fetch                          |
| **Notification Service** | Listens via RabbitMQ to send logs (simulated notifications)             |
| **Eureka Server**    | Service registry and discovery                                             |

## üì¨ Notification Service
- Listens to RabbitMQ messages from the Customer service.
- Logs received events (order created)

This simulates an event-driven notification system.

Sure! Here's a **short and concise version** of the authentication flow section:


## üîê Authentication Flow

1. **Register**

    * Users register via `POST /auth/register`.
    * Their credentials are saved securely in the database.

2. **Login**

    * Users log in via `POST /auth/login`.
    * A **JWT token** is generated and returned upon successful authentication.

3. **Make Authenticated Requests**

    * The client includes the JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
    * API Gateway forwards the request to the appropriate microservice.

4. **Token Validation**

    * Services call `POST /auth/validate` to verify the JWT.
    * The Auth Service checks its validity and responds with `true` or `false`.

5. **Secure & Stateless**

    * Tokens are signed and self-contained‚Äîno session storage needed.
    * Expired or tampered tokens are rejected.
